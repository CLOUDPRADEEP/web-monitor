**To check the status of multiple URLs using Python, you can employ the following script.**

**Prerequisites:**

* Python 3 or later
* `requests` library

**The script utilizes an input file named "A.txt." It iterates through the URLs in the file, checking their status and tracking the HTTP response code.**

* **HTTP code 000:** Down
* **HTTP code 400:** Taking longer to load
* **HTTP code 200:** Up

**A progress bar is displayed during the process.**

**Upon completion, the script generates an HTML file.** If an old HTML file exists, it is deleted before creating the new one.

**Would you like me to provide the Python code for this script?**
